# Runtime architecture

Picus keeps Bevy as the application scheduler and owns one retained runtime per
window. `MasonryRuntime` is a non-send resource containing the window runtimes;
each `WindowRuntime` owns the retained view state, action sink, hit-test state,
and paint bookkeeping for one Bevy window. The primary window is attached
automatically. Additional windows attach when their `Window` entity is seen.

The normal frame flow is:

```text
PreUpdate   input, retained routing, action dispatch
Update      application systems and state changes
PostUpdate  projection invalidation, synthesis, retained rebuild, IME sync
Last        paint and present for each attached window
```

Paint errors are captured as diagnostics. A frame is marked painted only after
`present()` succeeds, so a failed presentation cannot make later lifecycle
logic assume that pixels reached the window. Window size sent to the retained
runtime is logical size; pointer hit testing uses the event window's physical
cursor position.

Fonts registered through `AppPicusExt` are queued in `XilemFontBridge` and
broadcast to every attached window. A window that attaches later replays all
already registered font bytes. Theme backdrops are explicit: the application
can select one with `theme_backdrop`, while an explicit window setting takes
precedence over a stylesheet backdrop.

See [multi-window](../guide/multi-window.md), [i18n and fonts](../guide/i18n-fonts-icons.md),
and [styling and themes](../guide/styling-themes.md) for application-facing
configuration.
