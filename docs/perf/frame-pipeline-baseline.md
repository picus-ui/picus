# Frame pipeline baseline record

This file is the **versioned record** for frame-pipeline performance baselines.
PR descriptions may link here; they must not be the only place numbers live.

CPU-side `PICUS_FRAME_TIMING` phases measure submit-path wall time only. They are
**not** displayed-frame latency. On Windows, **PresentMon/ETW is required** for
any acceptance claim that involves drag ghosting or displayed-frame latency
(G3/G4 and later).

## 2. Repeatable protocol

### 2.1 Resolutions (fixed)

Run the full scenario matrix at **both**:

1. **1920×1080** client area (logical; match scale factor so physical is known)
2. **3840×2160** client area

Record both logical size and physical size (scale factor).

### 2.2 Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Interaction |
|----|----------|-------------|
| S1 | Gallery **Button** idle | No pointer motion after warm-up; no OS/surface invalidation expected |
| S2 | Gallery **Spinner** page, window still | Spinner (or indeterminate ProgressBar) animating; window not moved |
| S3 | Gallery **Spinner** page, **window drag** | Fixed drag trajectory (below) while spinner runs |

Use the same gallery navigation path each run (document the clicks).

### 2.3 Fixed window-drag trajectory (S3)

Use one of:

- **Manual scripted**: start at a known screen position; drag roughly along a
  horizontal figure-eight or left→right→left path spanning ≥ half the work area
  for the full sample window; same path every run; or
- **Automation** (preferred when available): same pixel path replayed by a tool.

Document which method was used. Do **not** change path mid-matrix.

### 2.4 Timing

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Warm-up | **10 s** | Reach steady state; do **not** include in stats |
| Sample | **30 s** | Capture PresentMon/ETW + optional `PICUS_FRAME_TIMING` log |
| Repeats | **×3 debug** and **×3 release** per resolution × scenario | Report median of run medians where noted |

### 2.5 PresentMon / ETW (required on Windows)

PresentMon (or equivalent ETW capture that yields per-presented-frame times) is
**mandatory** for Windows baselines. Optional tools elsewhere do not replace it
for G3/G4 claims.

Suggested capture:

1. Start PresentMon (or GPUView/WPA ETL) against the Picus example process.
2. Begin warm-up, then mark sample start/stop (or trim CSV to the 30 s window).
3. Archive raw CSV/ETL under a local or CI artifact path; paste **summaries** into
   §3 below (do not rely on PR body alone).

Minimum fields to extract:

- Presented frame count / rate
- Display latency or MsBetweenDisplayChange (tool-dependent name)
- Dropped / late frames if available
- Group results by actual present mode when known

### 2.6 CPU timing companion (optional but recommended)

```text
set PICUS_FRAME_TIMING=1
set RUST_LOG=picus_core::perf=info
# Default product path (transitional ~30 Hz anim-only present):
#   leave PICUS_ANIM_PRESENT_HZ unset
# Unthrottled anim present (baseline / debug only):
#   set PICUS_ANIM_PRESENT_HZ=0
#   (also accepted: off / none / false)
cargo run -p gallery --release
```

Record 1 Hz `picus frame timing` averages for the sample window. Remember:
`present_submit_ms` ≠ display time.

**How to read CPU averages:**

| Field group | Denominator |
|-------------|-------------|
| `anim_tick_ms` | All entered-work paint attempts for that window (`frames`) |
| `scene_build_*`, `surface_acquire`, `encode_*`, `composite`, `present_submit` | **Content paint attempts only** (`frames − anim_tick_only`, logged as `content_paint_frames`) so throttled anim-only zeros do not dilute encode/present |
| Process `input_dispatch_ms` / `synth_ms` / `rebuild_ms` | `bevy_frames` (not multi-window paint attempts) |
| Process `paint_ms` / `redraw_ms` / `present_ms` | **Content paint attempts** (`frames − anim_tick_only`, logged as process `content_paint_frames`); if that is 0, `present_ms=0` and paint/redraw fall back to all entered-work attempts |
| Process `frames` | Sum of per-window paint attempts (can be ≈ windows × Bevy paints) |

Also: `anim_tick_ms` currently includes rewrite inside `AnimFrame`; `scene_build_base_ms` is root `redraw()` only (see `runtime.md` Phase 0 honesty notes).

## 3. Result tables (fill per campaign)

### 3.1 CSV / ETL summary placeholders

| Run | Profile | Res | Scenario | PresentMon CSV / ETL path | Notes |
|-----|---------|-----|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| 1 | debug | 1080p | S1 | _path_ | |
| 2 | debug | 1080p | S2 | _path_ | |
| 3 | debug | 1080p | S3 | _path_ | |
| … | release | 4K | S3 | _path_ | |

### 3.2 Display-path latency (PresentMon/ETW)

Report **median / p95 / p99** of the chosen latency metric (name the column).

| Profile | Res | Scenario | Run medians (3) | Median-of-medians | p95 | p99 | Unit |
|---------|-----|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|-----|------|
| debug | 1080p | S3 | _ · _ · _ | _ | _ | _ | ms |
| release | 1080p | S3 | _ · _ · _ | _ | _ | _ | ms |
| debug | 4K | S3 | _ · _ · _ | _ | _ | _ | ms |
| release | 4K | S3 | _ · _ · _ | _ | _ | _ | ms |

### 3.3 Present counts

| Profile | Res | Scenario | presents / 30 s (3 runs) | Notes |
|---------|-----|----------|--------------------------|-------|
| release | 1080p | S1 Button idle | _ | Expect ~0 without OS invalidation (G6 target) |
| release | 1080p | S2 Spinner still | _ | With default throttle ≈ 30 Hz class |
| release | 1080p | S2 + `PICUS_ANIM_PRESENT_HZ=0` | _ | Unthrottled comparison only |

### 3.4 CPU phase averages (`PICUS_FRAME_TIMING`, ms)

Copy values from the per-window `picus frame timing` line. Present-path columns
are **content-paint means** (see §2.6), not diluted by `anim_tick_only` samples.
Record both `presented` and `anim_tick_only` counters for the sample window.

| Profile | Res | Scenario | anim_tick | scene_build_base | encode_base | composite | present_submit | presented | anim_tick_only | content_paint_frames |
|---------|-----|----------|-----------|------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| release | 1080p | S2 | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| release | 1080p | S3 | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |

## 4. Acceptance thresholds (campaign targets)

Phase 0 only requires the **skeleton and protocol** (G1). Numeric gates for later
phases (from the plan; refine when first real numbers exist):

| Gate | Intent | Threshold (plan) | Status |
|------|--------|------------------|--------|
| G1 | Named phases + per-window `frame_id` | Metrics log + this protocol | Skeleton in tree |
| G3 | Spinner still: design phases visible; indeterminate bar ≈ `0.9 × min(60, refresh_hz)` without permanent global throttle | PresentMon + content version | Pending architecture |
| G4 | Spinner drag: displayed-frame latency p95 ≤ 2 refresh periods; ≥30% better than P0 baseline; default path not permanent fps cut | PresentMon ×3 debug/release | Needs filled §3 as P0 baseline |
| G6 | Button idle present count = 0 in 30 s sample | Counter | Pending |
| G10 | Remove default 30 Hz anim throttle | Code review after G2–G4 | Blocked on P2e |

**P0 baseline freeze**: once §3 is first filled for a named commit, later PRs
compare against that row set (or a clearly marked newer baseline revision).
